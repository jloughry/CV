% The cmap package avoids the problem of ligatures like 'ffi' disappearing from a
% copy and paste operation where the destination is plain text.  This is important
% when sending out résumés in PDF if you want keywords to be spotted by automated
% filters used by HR.  Without the `resetfonts' option it doesn't do the trick with
% Computer Modern Roman.
%
% I use a modified ot1.cmap file in the current directory to tell PDF in addition
% to the ligatures mentioned above to also replace curly quotes with straight
% quotes and en dashes and em dashes with hyphens.  Copy and paste of text from the
% resulting PDF file will be 7-bit clean ASCII containing no Unicode characters at
% all.
