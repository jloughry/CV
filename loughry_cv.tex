% The cmap package avoids the problem of ligatures like 'ffi' disappearing from a
% copy and paste operation where the destination is plain text. This is important
% when sending out résumés in PDF if you want keywords to be spotted by automated
% filters used by HR. Without the `resetfonts' option it doesn't do the trick with
% Computer Modern Roman.
%
% I use a modified ot1.cmap and a modified oms.cmap and a modified cmap.sty file
% in the current directory to tell PDF that in addition to the ligatures mentioned
% above it should also replace curly quotes with straight quotes, en dashes and em
% dashes with hyphens, and bullets with asterisks or other ASCII characters. Copy
% and paste of text from the resulting PDF file will be 7-bit clean ASCII containing
% no Unicode characters at all. Be sure to load cmap immediately after the
% documentclass line so it can see all the fonts as they are loaded. This version
% of cmap.sty works with 11pt and 12pt options to documentclass unlike the original.
\usepackage[resetfonts]{cmap}
