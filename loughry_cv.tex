% The cmap package avoids the problem of ligatures like 'ffi' disappearing from a
% copy and paste operation where the destination is plain text.  This is important
% when sending out résumés in PDF if you want keywords to be spotted by automated
% filters used by HR.  Without the `resetfonts' option it doesn't do the trick with
% Computer Modern Roman.
%
% I use a modified ot1.cmap and a modified oms.cmap and a modified cmap.sty file
% in the current directory to tell PDF that in addition to the ligatures mentioned
% above it should also replace curly quotes with straight quotes, en dashes and em
% dashes with hyphens, and bullets with asterisks or other ASCII characters.  Copy
% and paste of text from the resulting PDF file will be 7-bit clean ASCII containing
% no Unicode characters at all.  Be sure to load cmap immediately after the
% documentclass line so it can see all the fonts as they are loaded.  This version
% of cmap.sty works with 11pt and 12pt options to documentclass unlike the original.

\section*{Work Experience}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Graduate Research Student, University of Oxford, England, from January 2012--present.
		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			\emph{Having wrapped up a three-year-long R\&D contract for the Air Force Research
			Lab in January of 2012, it was necessary to finish writing my dissertation by
			the deadline.}
		\end{quote}

	\item Information Assurance Engineer, Lockheed Martin Corporation, from 2006--January 2012.
		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			\emph{Reorganised into the INFOSEC group at Lockheed, I designed a new
			cryptosystem leading to another patent application and began studying
			government security evaluation standards.  Deciding to solve the C\&A problem,
			I took my thesis to the computer science department, telecommuting from the UK and
			proposing and winning an AFRL contract while I was gone.}
		\end{quote}

	\item Software Engineer, Lockheed Martin IS\&GS Western Region, from February 1998--2006.
		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			\emph{The optical TEMPEST research, not yet published in the open literature but of
			considerable interest to the intelligence community, led to a security clearance and
			a job writing code for Trusted Solaris.  I travelled around the U.S.\ and Britain
			writing code and installing systems and got interested along the way in
			Certification and Accreditation (C\&A) of systems.}
		\end{quote}

	\item System Administrator, Wells Fargo \& Company, Seattle, Washington,
		from 1996--September 1997.
		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			\emph{After being acquired by Wells Fargo, I moved to sysadmin of its network
			of X terminals, Cisco routers, and structured cabling.  Using the facilities
			at Seattle U., I ran experiments in optical TEMPEST that would eventually
			be cited in 14 books on information security.}
		\end{quote}

	\item Programmer, Safeco Life Insurance Company, Redmond, Washington, for a few months
		in 1991.
		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			\emph{I maintained a database application for a short time at this company
				between assignments.}
		\end{quote}

	\item Programmer/Analyst II, First Interstate Bank of Washington, Seattle,
		from 1990--91 and 1991--96.
		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			\emph{Five of us worked on retail bank automation software in machine language
			(see my GitHub at}
			\url{https://github.com/jloughry/BANCStar/blob/master/README.md#code-sample}
			\emph{for the reason why).  Network traffic coexisted with IBM 3270 terminals
			and was limited to one direction only; with no way to back out any changes from
			production, we were very careful.}
