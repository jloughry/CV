\section*{Work Experience} % most recent first

\begin{itemize}
	\item Graduate Research Student, University of Oxford, England, from January 2012--present.

		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			Having wrapped up a three year research and development contract for the U.S.\ Air
			Force, I took advantage of a funding crunch at Lockheed to leave and finish writing
			my dissertation.
		\end{quote}

	\item Information Assurance Engineer, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Littleton, Colorado, from
		2006--2012.

		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			Reorganised into the INFOSEC department at Lockheed, I designed a cryptosystem that
			led to another patent application and began studying in earnest all of the government
			security evaluation standards.  Deciding to solve the problem once and for all, I
			took my thesis to Oxford, telecommuting successfully my responsibilities for the firm.
		\end{quote}

	\item Software Engineer, Lockheed Martin IS\&GS Western Region, from 1998--2006.

		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			That research, which had not been published yet in the open literature but was being
			reviewed by the intelligence community, led to a security clearance and a job writing
			code for Trusted Solaris.  I travelled around the U.S.\ and Britain writing code and
			installing systems and got interested along the way in Certification and
			Accreditation (C\&A).
		\end{quote}

	\item System Administrator, Wells Fargo \& Company, Seattle, Washington, from  1996--1997.

		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			When the bank was acquired by Wells Fargo, I moved to sysadmining their network of X
			terminals, Cisco routers, ethernet and structured cabling.  Off hours, I took classes
			at Seattle University and ran the experiments that would eventually be cited in 14
			books on security.
		\end{quote}

	\item Programmer/Analyst II, First Interstate Bank of Washington, Seattle, from 1990--1996.

		\begin{quote}\vspace{-2mm}
			Five people wrote software, mostly in assembly language, for a few hundred early PCs
			in 150 bank branches scattered across the state.  Network communications were limited
			to one-way only, piggybacked on IBM mainframe traffic.  With no way to back out
			changes from production, we were \emph{very} careful.
		\end{quote}
